Statement of Individual Contribution

Sam: implementing BFS, DFS, methods to refine solution path for BFS-DFS-Greedy, map-density heuristic, overall code structure, lab report.
Bum Jun: implementing A* search, modifying for multiple dots, methods of producing the final shortest path and other statistics, lab report. 

Overall, we think we worked well as a group and we both spent an equal amount of effort and time into this assignment.
